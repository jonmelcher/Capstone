// Tier:Cell coordinate system to start at 0:0 (for IO cell) and increment up from there,
// wrapping after the fifth cell, so 0:5 is followed by 1:0, ending around 4:5 or 5:5
// depending on how many cells we end up making.
// When a vehicle is no longer housed in the garage, should the co-ordinate become a non-permissive
// value, like 9:9 or something?  Will this matter if Stored is changed to false?
//
// IMPORTANT: We only have 30-or-so RFID tags, so we shouldn't make more cells than we have tags!
